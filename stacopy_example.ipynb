    "# Using stacopy\n",
    "\n",
    "`stacopy` guides the use of the $k$-means unsupervised clustering method (\"`k-means`\"; MacQueen 1967; Lloyd 1982) for samples in which the true clustering structure is not known. `k-means`, which partitions samples into $k$ compact, spherical clusters, uses randomised initialisations to overcome its local dependency. Different initialisations lead to different clustering outcomes, and clustering outcomes may be more or less varied at different values of $k$. Therefore, one needs to be able to not only a) identify the best clustering outcome at a given value of $k$, but b) identify the best value of $k$ for modelling the clustering structure of a sample. `stacopy` does both, identifying the most compact clustering outcomes and the most stables values of $k$.\n",
