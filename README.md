# stacopy
stacopy is a Python 3 implementation of the stability-compactness approach that my team and I use to k-means cluster galaxies. The approach is malleable and may be readily adapted for other data sets and other algorithms.

stacopy.py contains the functions used to apply our approach. stacopy_example.ipynb is a jupyter notebook which demonstrates the use of these functions.
